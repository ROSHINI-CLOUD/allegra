## 🎧 About

LuvLyrics is an open-source, **local-first** music library and lyrics app built with Expo, React Native, TypeScript, SQLite, and Zustand.

The app is built around one core obsession: a **premium lyrics-reading experience** — perfectly timed synced lyrics, plain lyric auto-scroll, multi-source lyric fetching, local playlist management, cover art tools, and a native Android player that just works.

Recent highlights:

- **Hybrid Kotlin native architecture** — four Expo Modules API Kotlin modules replace JS-thread bottlenecks:
  - `StartupModule` preloads songs/playlists in `Application.onCreate()`, cutting cold-start from ~1.5 s to ~500 ms
  - `MainPlayerModule` uses Media3 ExoPlayer + MediaSessionService — fixes notification buttons (⏮ ⏸/▶ ⏭), lock-screen controls, and Bluetooth headphone skip
  - `LuvsPlayerModule` manages a 6-slot ExoPlayer pool for instant swipe-to-next on the Luvs reel (zero JS bridge round-trips during gesture)
  - `DownloaderModule` uses WorkManager `CoroutineWorker` so downloads survive app backgrounding and device restarts
- Player end-of-song detection is more reliable with a near-end fallback that triggers the next track even when `didJustFinish` misses
- Download progress UI is smoother with throttled callbacks and concurrent downloads increased to 2
- Lyrics scrolling is buttery-smooth with `@shopify/flash-list` view recycling, debounced layout measurements, and binary-search active-line detection
- Desktop bridge is temporarily disabled (code preserved for future re-enablement)

## 🧠 Architecture

### Player

```
PlayerContext.tsx          →  wraps useAudioPlayer, syncs status to Zustand, handles auto-next
playerStatusGuard.ts       →  preserves playing state during buffering/seek to prevent UI flicker
usePlayerStore (Zustand)   →  single source of truth for isPlaying, currentSong, position, queue
MiniPlayer.tsx             →  expanded player UI (Dynamic Island + Classic styles), handles seek
```

### Scrub/seek pattern (must follow everywhere)

```ts
const wasPlaying = usePlayerStore.getState().isPlaying;
await player.seekTo(time);
if (wasPlaying) player.play();
```

`seekTo` is async and pauses playback — always resume if the user was playing.

### Auto-next (end of song)

`PlayerContext` uses `didJustFinish` (cross-platform signal) as primary, plus a `isNearEndFallback` (within 0.35 s of end) as secondary. The fallback only triggers when `store.isPlaying` is true — prevents auto-advancing when user manually pauses near end.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Most features work without API keys — several services have public or fallback paths. Create `.env` from `.env.example` and fill only what you need.

| Variable | Required | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | `AuthService` | Needed for Google sign-in flows |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Optional | `GeniusService` | Improves Genius lyric search reliability |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SAAVN_API_URL` | Optional | `SpotifyBridgeService` | Primary Saavn-compatible API base URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SAAVN_SECONDARY_API_URL` | Optional | `MultiSourceSearchService` | Secondary fallback API base URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GAANA_API_URL` | Optional | `MultiSourceSearchService` | Gaana-compatible fallback API base URL |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_SECRET` | Optional | `MultiSourceSearchService` | Only if your API endpoint expects a shared secret |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | `SpotifyService` | Needed for Spotify metadata flows |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Not recommended | `SpotifyService` | Do not ship real client secrets in public mobile builds — use a backend proxy |

> **Security note:** `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values are bundled into the client app — treat them as public. Never commit `.env`, real tokens, private keys, `credentials.json`, or Firebase service files.

---

## ✅ Quality Checks

Run the full local CI bundle before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run ci
```

This runs:

- Secret scan: `npm run security:secrets`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Tests with coverage: `npm run test:ci`

You can also run checks individually:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

3. Make the smallest useful change.
4. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
5. Run `npm run ci`.
6. Open a PR using the template.
