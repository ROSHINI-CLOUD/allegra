# LuvLyrics design system

LuvLyrics is a lyrics-first music player. It shares Allegra's visual language —
album art supplies the atmosphere, frosted material separates content, one
stable action colour stays legible over any artwork — and adapts it to a phone
held in one hand, on hardware as old as a five-year-old mid-range Android.

The feeling to aim for: a dark listening room lit by the cover that is playing.
Calm at rest, responsive under the finger, never busy.

This is the contract for new screens and for visual refactors. When this file
and the code disagree, fix one of them in the same change.

## 1. Colour

### Stable colours (`Signal` in `allegraTheme.ts`)

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wave` | `#d9e66a` | Primary action, selected state, progress, the playing row |
| `waveInk` | `#17180d` | Text and icons on a `wave` fill |
| `accent` | `#ee6b5f` | Liked, love, destructive-but-warm (remove from playlist) |
| `ink` | `#f4f1ea` | Primary text |
| `inkSoft` | `#d1d0c9` | Secondary text that must still read over art |
| `inkMuted` | `#8e9498` | Metadata, hints |
| `inkFaint` | `#626b70` | Placeholders, disabled |
| `bg` / `bgDeep` / `bgSubtle` | `#0a0b0e` / `#07080b` / `#12141a` | Page, deepest room, wells |

Rules

- Chartreuse means "act here" or "this one is on". Never decoration.
- Coral means love. The heart, the Luv button, the liked badge. Nothing else.
- No new one-off accent. If a role is missing, add a token first.
- The app is dark. Light mode exists for text-heavy settings only; the player,
  Stream, Luvs, Search and Library are always the dark room.

### Artwork colour

`useArtworkPalette(uri)` extracts the cover's colours natively on Android
(`NativePalette`) with Allegra's vivify rules, falling back to a supplied
duotone, then to Allegra's default room. Artwork colour may tint:

- the live shader (`DynamicAura`),
- glass washes (`Frosted` palette prop),
- the colour that rises at the foot of a Luvs card,
- glows behind featured art.

It must never recolour text or the `wave` action colour.

---

## 2. Material

### Frosted glass

Floating surfaces (menus, sheets, the voice card) use `allegra/Frosted`: real
blur on both platforms (`experimentalBlurMethod` on Android), a thin dark tint,
an optional cover wash, a specular sheen and a lit top edge.

**Never put live blur on always-visible chrome.** The tab bar and the now
playing pill blur a *bitmap* of the cover once (`Image blurRadius`) under a dark
tint. A live Android blur re-renders on every scroll frame.

### The cheap blur

For any large blurred background (Luvs backdrop, cover glows): decode a tiny copy
(`resizeMethod="resize"`, 24–36 px), blur that, and scale it up with a
transform. Blurring a thumbnail is instant; blurring a full-resolution cover on
the CPU takes 1–2 s on older phones, which is exactly the "sharp, then fogs
over" glitch Luvs used to have. Every mounted card carries its blur from the
first frame — never gate blur on `isActive`.

### Hierarchy

One glass surface plus quieter wells. Don't stack opaque cards to fake depth.

| Surface | Radius | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tab bar | pill | cover bitmap blur + tint, hairline, top highlight |
| Now playing pill | pill, 56 px, max 330 | blurred cover / glow / solid; `wave` progress ring round the art |
| More menu / sheets | 26–30 | `Frosted`, dim + blur behind |
| Luvs card | 30 | art (or canvas while playing) full-bleed, hairline edge; the next in the lane peeks over its top |
| Content wells, search field | 16 / pill | `rgba(255,255,255,0.06–0.10)` + hairline |
| Artwork | 16 (thumbs 10–12) | crisp; never over-rounded |
| Icon buttons | circle, ≥ 40 px | `Glass.fillLight` + hairline |

---

## 3. Type

SF Pro everywhere (see CLAUDE.md for how Android gets it). Styles set only
`fontWeight` and `fontSize`.

| Role | Size / weight |
| --- | --- |
| Page title (Stream, Search, Library, Luvs) | 28 / 700 |
| Shelf heading (`SectionHeading`) | 22 / 700 + optional 13 / 400 subtitle |
| Featured title, player title | 22 / 700, 22 / 600 |
| Row title / subtitle | 15–16 / 600 · 13 / 400 |
| Chip / button label | 14–15 / 600 |
| Meta, times | 12–13, tabular numbers |

Sentence case, always. No all-caps, no tracking on labels, no emoji or sparkle
glyphs in UI copy, no "magic" wording.

## 4. Layout and the bottom chrome

```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ status bar scrim         │
│ Title          (glass ○) │
│ search field / mood chips│
│ …content…                │
│                          │
│ ╭ now playing pill ────╮ │  ← every screen except Luvs & the player
│ ╰──────────────────────╯ │
│ ╭ Stream Luvs 🎙 Library •••╮│  ← floating tab bar
└──────────────────────────┘
```

- Gutter: 20 px (`GUTTER` in `StreamHome`). Headings and content share it.
- Everything that scrolls pads its bottom with `useBottomClearance()` — tab bar
  plus the pill when it shows. Don't hardcode 100/180/208 again.
- The ••• menu, the pill and the voice card are mounted at the **root**
  (`RootNavigator`), in that paint order: pill → menu (`MoreMenuHost`) → voice
  card. The tab bar owns the menu's state and publishes it through
  `HostedMoreMenu`, so the menu always opens on top of the pill.
- A new destination goes in `MORE_ITEMS`, not in the tab bar.

---

## 5. The player

### Now playing pill (`PillPlayer`)

Default mini player (`miniPlayerStyle: 'pill'`), modelled on Echo Music's
NewMiniPlayer. Shows on every screen in the tab shell except Luvs. Round art
inside a `wave` progress ring, title over artist, then previous · play · next.
The play button is Echo's nine-lobed "cookie": a circle at rest that grows soft
lobes and turns once every 8 s while music plays.

| Gesture | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tap | open the player |
| Swipe up | open the player, carrying the flick's speed into the sheet |
| Drag sideways | the row follows the finger; past 60 px or faster than 600 px/s, it skips |

The row springs home without bounce. It is 54 px tall: 40 px art in its ring,
a 40 px cookie, 18 px skip glyphs.

The Dynamic Island (`island`) and classic bar (`bar`) remain as settings.

### Player sheet (`NowPlayingScreen` + `navigation/playerSheet.ts`)

The route is a transparent modal with no native animation; the screen animates
itself so it can be dragged.

- **It is the pill, grown.** Closed, the sheet rests on the pill's top edge,
  scaled to the pill's width (`playerSheetRest`); open, it is full screen. One
  progress value (`navigation/sheetProgress.ts`) drives both: the pill rides
  the sheet's top edge and fades over the first tenth of the travel while the
  sheet turns solid over the first eighth, so the two overlap with no gap.
- **Open:** a clamped spring (`stiffness 240, damping 32`) from the pill, carrying
  the swipe's speed.
- **Drag down from anywhere** to close. Over the lyrics the drag belongs to the
  list until it is scrolled to its top (Apple Music's split). A grab mid-flight
  takes over from where the sheet is; past the top it rubber-bands.
- **Release:** the decision uses where the flick is heading (momentum
  projection), not where the finger let go: past 22 % of the screen or faster
  than 900 px/s → a clamped spring back onto the pill with the finger's speed;
  otherwise it springs open.
- **The page underneath** is drawn (the route is transparent) and blurred while
  the sheet is up, clearing as it lowers — the blur's opacity follows the
  progress. It is mounted only while the sheet moves; low-end phones dim instead.
- Back button and the chevron use the same exit (`usePreventRemove`).
- Controls never auto-hide.

### Player look (Settings → Player)

**Apple Music inspired** (switch): the cover runs full width across the top and
melts into its own blur — Echo's hero, with the canvas playing inside it. Off
shows a floating artwork card.

**Player background:**

| Style | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Apple Music** | Echo's style: the cover blurred soft behind a sharp hero |
| **Apple + glow** (default, `blend`) | the Apple Music room, cross-fading into Echo's drifting glow while lyrics are open |

"Glow animated" on its own was retired; a stored `glow` migrates to Apple + glow.

**Mini player background:** glow animated (two blobs in the cover's colours) or
cover tint.

### Player menu and sheets

••• opens a tall frosted sheet in Echo's order: Radio · Add · Share as pill
buttons, then rounded rows (Cast, Ambient mode, Lyrics, Shuffle, Download,
Like, Repeat, Refetch), View artist, Set as ringtone, Listen together, and
Details · Equalizer · Advanced. A row that would do nothing for this song is
not shown. Active modes (liked, repeat, in a room) tint their icon `wave`.
Results come back as a short toast, never an alert.

**Listen together** is a sheet too: name + "Start a room" (`wave`), or a room
code to join; inside, the big room code with copy / share, join requests with
Decline / Let in, who's listening (host badge, dimmed when offline) and End /
Leave. A join request also appears as a frosted card at the top of any screen.
While in a room the player shows a small "Listening together · n" chip under
the grabber.

**Ambient mode** fills the screen with the canvas (or the cover, centred) and
the title underneath, keeps the screen awake, and returns on a tap or back.

### Canvas

Decorative, muted, never takes audio focus. The cover stays under it, so
whatever the canvas reveals is the cover, never a gap. It never vanishes mid-frame: when
the song changes the old clip fades out (520 ms) before the next one fades in
on its first frame. The layer has no backing of its own, so before the first
frame (or on a frame the decoder hasn't filled) the cover underneath shows,
never black. The loop is the player's own repeat, which holds the last frame
until the next one is ready — no fade at the seam. `CanvasVideoLayer` sizes the video
from its real track dimensions to a true cover fit and renders into a
TextureView on Android (a SurfaceView ignores fades, clips and the sheet's
drag). The lookup keys on title + artist only, so metadata backfill mid-song
can't blank it.

---

## 6. Screens

| Screen | Recipe |
| --- | --- |
| **Stream** | `DynamicAura`, title, mood chips, shortcut grid, quick picks, cover shelves. Double-tap the Stream tab: scroll to the top, focus search, keyboard up (the first tap still switches at once) |
| **Search** | same room; one field for the phone *and* the catalog; scopes All · On this phone · Online; recent searches; mood tiles |
| **Library** | same room; the **cover deck** (recent songs as a staggered stack of sleeves — tap the front one to play, flick to leaf through; order lives on the UI thread so a flick never flickers), **Play all · Shuffle** under it and again in a frosted sticky bar once you scroll past, **Your artists** (round covers sized by how many songs you keep, tap to filter), Downloading, then Songs with filter, sort (Recently added · A–Z · By artist) and an **A–Z rail** (letter bubble, a tick per letter, jumps by fixed 64 pt rows) |
| **Playlist** | CoverFlow deck, playlist name, meta + sort chip, **Play / Shuffle** (transport lives in the pill), glass header that fades in on scroll |
| **Luvs** | a **taste map**, not a feed: lanes of taste side by side (For you, one per favourite artist, your chill and energy mixes) that turn like a carousel with the neighbours peeking at the edges; each lane is a stack — swipe up and the card lifts away while the next grows from behind, swipe down to bring the last one back. A lane rail slides with the camera and counts how deep you are. Under the map: title, clip scrubber, Luv · Save · Full song · Share (springy presses, a heart burst on Luv). The cover blurred small is the room |
| **Player** | canvas or artwork stage, grab handle, controls on a scrim, `wave` play button; tap the artist to open their page |
| **Artist** | Echo's layout: one sharp square photo masked into the shader (drifts at ⅓ scroll, stretches on overscroll), 40/700 name on its foot, subscriber + `wave` monthly chips, About, Play · Radio · Shuffle, Top songs, On this phone, shelves (albums, singles, fans also like as round avatars) |

### Shader at rest

`DynamicAura` keeps the field lit when nothing plays (66% opacity, 0.34 energy)
— at 30% under the scrims the Stream page read as plain black. Screens pass a
small `dim` (0.06 Stream, ~0.14 elsewhere); don't stack extra dark scrims on it.

---

## 7. Motion

Primitives: `RiseIn`, `Tactile`, `SwapText`, `MorphIcon`, `NudgeIcon`
(`allegra/motion.tsx`). Reuse them.

- Springs for anything a finger can interrupt; 160–400 ms timings for state.
- 40 ms list staggers, capped at 10 items.
- **Transform and opacity only.** No animated `height`, `width`, `top`,
  `backgroundColor` or `borderRadius`. Equaliser bars use `scaleY` from the
  baseline; progress bars use `scaleX` from the left; a header "turns solid" by
  fading a scrim, not by animating its colour.
- At most two self-running effects per screen (e.g. the shader + a canvas).
- Reduce Motion collapses movement to fades; it never removes a feature.

### Old-phone budget

- One gesture per component, worklets on the UI thread, cross to JS only when a
  discrete value changes (the lyric line).
- `DynamicAura` gets `active={isFocused}` so hidden screens stop their shader.
- Lists over ~30 rows use FlashList.
- Blur thumbnails, not full covers.
- Rows respond on the first tap — no multi-tap timers in front of the common case.

## 8. Home-screen widgets (Android)

Built with `react-native-android-widget`; glyphs are inline SVG (`widget/icons.ts`).

**Now playing** (3×3, resizable): a soft frame around the cover full-bleed; a
glass pill with the song, share and like circles; elapsed / remaining; a white
progress bar; round dark-glass transport buttons. Below ~190 dp it drops text.

**Playlist** (4×3, resizable): cover, name, count, a `wave` play button and ›
to cycle playlists; a scrollable list where the playing row wears `wave`.

The app writes a snapshot (`widget/widgetData.ts`) on song, play-state, like and
playlist changes, plus a 20 s tick while playing. Transport acts on the live
player; rows, "play playlist" and share are `lyricflow://widget/…` deep links so
they work from a cold start. RemoteViews can't blur: "frosted" there means a
dark translucent fill.

## 9. Checklist for a new screen

1. Dark room: `Signal.bg`, `DynamicAura` (with `active={isFocused}`) or a
   cheap-blur backdrop — not flat black.
2. 28/700 sentence-case title on the gutter; glass round buttons for actions.
3. Shelves with `SectionHeading`; rows with `SongRow` / `PlaylistItem`.
4. Bottom padding from `useBottomClearance()`.
5. Play/pause through `requestPlayback`; open the player with `openPlayerSheet`.
6. Loading, empty and offline states designed, never blank glass.
7. Transform/opacity motion from the primitives; check on a low-end phone.
