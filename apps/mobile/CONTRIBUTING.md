LuvLyrics is an official GSSoC 2026 project.

**Assignment rule:** Comment on the issue you want to work on and wait for a
maintainer to assign it before writing any code. Unassigned PRs will not earn
GSSoC points and may be closed without review.

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs
- Propose features
- Improve documentation
- Add tests
- Refactor and optimize existing code

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LuvLyricsApp.git
cd LuvLyricsApp
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Android Studio

Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and ensure the
Android SDK and an emulator (or physical device) are configured. Run
`npx expo-doctor` after setup to verify your environment is ready.

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

Run on Android:

```bash
npm run android
```

> **Note:** LuvLyrics targets Android only. iOS builds are not supported.

## Troubleshooting

If setup or local checks fail, start with these quick checks.

Confirm you are using Node.js 20 or newer:

```bash
node --version
```

If dependencies look stale after pulling changes or switching branches, install
them again:

```bash
npm install
```

If a local environment file is needed, copy the example file and fill only the
values you need for your work:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Run the same checks that CI uses:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ci
```

Docs-only work, linting, typechecking, and unit tests usually do not require
Firebase or Google credentials. If Android or emulator setup fails, check
the platform setup notes in `README.md`.

## Branch Naming

Use clear, scoped branch names:

- `feat/<short-description>`
- `fix/<issue-number>-short-description`
- `docs/<short-description>`
- `refactor/<short-description>`
- `test/<short-description>`

Examples:

- `feat/persistent-queue-sqlite`
- `fix/85-magic-number-comments`

## Commit Message Style

Prefer conventional commits:

- `feat: add local lrc export action`
- `fix: prevent queue duplication on retry`
- `docs: improve setup instructions`

## Pull Request Process

> **Rule: every PR must be linked to an issue. PRs opened without a linked issue will be closed without review.**
> If no issue exists yet, open one first and wait for a maintainer to confirm it's in scope before starting work.

1. Open or find an issue — get it confirmed before writing code
2. Create a focused branch from `main` following the branch naming convention above
3. Keep PR scope small — one issue per PR
4. Add/update tests where relevant
5. Run CI checks locally before pushing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:ci
```

6. Open PR using the template, fill every section, and put `Closes #<issue-number>` in the Related Issue field
7. Wait for a maintainer review — do not merge your own PR

## Automated PR Checks

Every pull request to `main` runs GitHub Actions.

Required checks:

- Secret scan: blocks committed API keys, private keys, `.env`, and credential files
- Dependency review: blocks high-severity dependency changes
- Lint: runs `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: runs `npm run typecheck`
- Unit tests: runs `npm run test:ci` with coverage output

PRs should stay red until these checks pass. Maintainers can then enable branch protection in GitHub settings and require the `Lint, Typecheck, Test` and `Dependency Review` checks before merge.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript types instead of `any` when possible
- Avoid large unrelated refactors in the same PR
- Preserve existing architecture and naming patterns
- Keep UI changes visually consistent with the app style

## Issue Labels
